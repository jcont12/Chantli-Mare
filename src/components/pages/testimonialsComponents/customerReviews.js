The friendliness , the personalized attention of Don Roberto and his team made our 9 day stay a real success.”'</td>
            <td>'“ It should be evident then that the ambience at the Boutique Inn was addictive. The attention to all things by Roberto (the owner) Chef Greg, and his smiling and very competent staff, simply made it one of the most comfortable places we have encountered over many years. Add to this the attractiveness of the area, the 6 km beach, the lovely trappings beneath the palapa, and all of it so well kept. Exceptional details of design and comfort seem to be something we expected after meeting Roberto and so it was found to be.”'</td>
            <td>'“We really loved our stay in Chantli Mare and I think it is the most beautifully designed hotel I have stayed in so far. The atmosphere is wonderful. Everything is perfect - the rooms, the restaurant, the pool area. The owner is a very friendly man who really takes good care of his guests.”'</td>

I enjoyed every meal there ( and yes i almost tried everything in the menu because i just didnt find any reason to eat in another place), the cook did a fantastic job. Staff was friendly and helpful, the owner helped is to organize trips. Thanks for an unforgettable time in chantli mare! I recommend it to anyone.”'</td>
            <td>'“This place is a gem as you walk 10 feet out the door of your room to a beach that feels almost private. There is nothing touristy about this place. The little dirt road that leads you to this 6 room B&B brings you nothing but surprise and delight. The rooms and property are spotless - even after the hurricane. The food is the best around. You have to try to the pesto omelette! Roberto loves this place and it shows.”'</td>
            <td>'“This is definitely a hidden gem! The setting is beautiful, the owner, Roberto, couldn’t have been more attentive and the food was WONDERFUL! The rooms were very clean and comfortable. We only planned to stay one night but enjoyed our stay so much, we added another night. I would definitely recommend this boutique hotel for a family or for a romantic get-away!”'</td>
